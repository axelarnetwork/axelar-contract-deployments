[Release](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/releases/tag/v1.2.4)

## Background

This patch release enables EIP-7702 support in the vald node. EIP-7702 introduces a new transaction type that allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to temporarily function as smart contracts during a transaction.

This is a vald-only upgrade that affects validator voting behavior. The changes are non-consensus breaking, so accidental upgrade of the blockchain node should be fine as well.

## Deployment

- Stop the vald node

- Replace the binary with `axelard v1.2.4`

- Restart the vald node

## Checklist

- Ensure the vald node resumes normal operation
- Verify validator voting is functioning correctly
- Check that EIP-7702 transactions are being processed properly, if there are any

## Troubleshooting

### Rollback

If you encounter issues after upgrading to v1.2.4, roll back to v1.2.3:

1. Stop the vald node
2. Replace the binary with `axelard v1.2.3`
3. Restart the vald node
