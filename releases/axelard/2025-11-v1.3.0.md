[Release TBD](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-core/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

## Background

Changes in the release:

1. Updates Cosmos SDK to v0.50, WasmD to v0.54, WasmVM to v2.2, CometBFT to v0.38, also updates various other dependencies.
2. The governance module now uses the new message-based governance proposals
3. Breaking changes to all our protobuf messages (`Sender` field), so clients need to be updated
4. Some of the Cosmos SDK modules include in-place storage migrations

## Deployment

- If building from source, use Go 1.25
- libwasmvm has been updated from `v1.5.8` to `v2.2.4`, make sure to update the dependency if you are using the `axelard` binary.
- [Update ampd to 1.14] at the same time
- Needs upgrade proposal to be submitted and passed
- Stop the node and ampd once upgrade height is reached
- Restart the node and ampd with the new binaries

[Update ampd to 1.14]: ../ampd/2025-11-17-ampd-v1.14.0.md

## Checklist

- [ ] Verify that nodes are producing new blocks after the upgrade.
- [ ] For Axelar maintainers: Go through testing steps to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Troubleshooting

### App Hash Error
If you encounter hash error ensure you have libwasm v2.2.4 which can be obtained from https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmvm/releases/download/v2.2.4/libwasmvm.x86_64.so. Before restarting node:

1. Ensure system environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is specified to correct location if using binary. For docker image no change is necessary.

## Testing

Since this is a large upgrade, we need to ensure that everything is working as expected. After upgrading devnet-amplifier, we should verify the following:

- [ ] General testing: GMP calls, IBC transfers, key rotation
- [ ] New `UpdateParams` message works in new message-based proposals as expected. To check this, submit a proposal to change a parameter for one of our modules.
- [ ] Do some GMP calls
- [ ] Test Rosetta API is working. To do this, a rosetta checker needs to be spun up and run against one of the nodes. Haiyi and Steven can help with this.
