## Deployment

- Ensure that ITS Hub has been upgraded to [v1.1.0](../cosmwasm/2025-01-ITS-v1.1.0.md) first.
- The rollout involves deploying Sui ITS contracts version `v1.1.2` on Sui.

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### Deploy move contracts
- Sync move directories
```bash
node sui/deploy-contract.js sync
```

- Delete existing gas `GasService` & `Example` config from `$ENV.json`

- Deploy GasService contract
```bash
node sui/deploy-contract.js deploy GasService
```

- Transfer cap to Operators contract
```bash
node sui/operators.js storeCap
```

- Deploy InterchainTokenService and Example contract
```bash
node sui/deploy-contract.js deploy InterchainTokenService
node sui/deploy-contract.js deploy Example
```

### Register Sui ITS on ITS Hub

ITS hub contract configuration in json file must include the following attributes per chain:
```bash
"axelar": {
  "contracts": {
    ...
    "InterchainTokenService": {
      ...
      "some-sui-chain": {
        "maxUintBits": 64,
        "maxDecimalsWhenTruncating": 8
      }
    }
    ...
  }
}
```

### Submit Proposal
*Note: Mainnet proposal should include a community post for the Registering ITS*

deposit amount is one of:
| Network  | Deposit Amount |
|----------|---------------|
| Devnet   | 100000000     |
| Stagenet | 100000000     |
| Testnet  | 2000000000    |
| Mainnet  | 2000000000    |

```bash
node cosmwasm/submit-proposal.js its-hub-register-chains sui -t "Register ITS for Sui chain" -d "Register ITS for Sui chain at ITS Hub contract" --deposit $DEPOSIT_AMOUNT
```

### Setting up trusted addresses on Sui
```bash
# Add all trusted chains to ITS Sui
node sui/its.js add-trusted-chains all
```

### Setting up trusted addresses on EVM
```bash
# For these commands replace Sui's PRIVATE KEY in .env with private key for EVM chains
node evm/its.js set-trusted-address sui hub -n all
```

## Checklist

The following checks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ]  Run the following to test ITS transfer

```bash
# Deploy Test Tokens
node sui/its-example deploy-token --origin TST "Test Token" 8

# Send Token Deployment to Gateway
node sui/its-example send-deployment TST [destinationChain] 0.5

# Send Tokens to Destination chain
node sui/its-example send-token TST [destinationChain] [destinationAddress] 0.5 1

# Initiate token transfer from both EVM chains too
node evm/its.js interchain-transfer sui [tokenId] [recipientAddress] 1 0.5 
```
