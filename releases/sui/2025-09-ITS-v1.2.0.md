[Release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui/tag/v1.2.0)

## Deployment

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create a `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain. On `devnet-amplifier` chain name will be set to `sui-2`.

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### ITS Contract Admin & Roles

Many of the below commands require either Owner or Operator privileges on the ITS contract.

#### OwnerCap

Some commands require a wallet that owns the contract's admin capability (`OwnerCap`). By default, this will be the address that deployed the ITS v0 contract.

The commands requiring this capability are:
* [Upgrading the ITS move contract][]
* [Enabling the Upgrade][]
* [Disabling the Legacy Contract][]

#### OperatorCap

Migrating legacy coin metadata requires a `OperatorCap` capability. This is any address added as an operator for the affected coin. By default, the address that deployed and initialized the ITS v0 contract possesses a `OperatorCap`.

The commands requiring this capability are:
* [Migrating Legacy Tokens][]

### Fetching Legacy Tokens

To fix the issue of some tokens not displaying correctly in wallets, we need to fetch the affected tokens. This list can be fetched before, or after the upgrade.

```bash
# Save legacy tokens for later migration
ts-node sui/tokens legacy-coins
```

### Upgrading the ITS move contract ###

1. Update the release dependency in `package.json`

```diff
- "@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui": "1.1.3",
+ "@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui": "1.2.0",
```

and run
```bash
npm i
```

2. Update the move contracts locally

```bash
ts-node sui/deploy-contract sync
```
3. Do the upgrade tx

- Note: use PRIVATE_KEY of `UpgradeCap` object of v0 ITS

```bash
# Upgrade InterchainTokenService v0 -> v1
ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService any_upgrade
```

### Enabling the Upgrade ###

Migrate version control state to enable the upgrade. 

- Note: use PRIVATE_KEY of `UpgradeCap` object of v0 ITS

```bash
ts-node sui/deploy-contract migrate InterchainTokenService
```

## Checklist

The following post-upgrade tasks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ] Disable the legacy ITS contract
- [ ] Verify Version Control state (v0 and v1)
- [ ] Re-deploy Example contract
- [ ] Fetch metadata of legacy coins (if not already fetched)
- [ ] Migrate metadata of legacy coins
- [ ] Test ITS token deployment and transfers
- [ ] Test custom token linking

### Disabling the Legacy Contract ###

```bash
# Disallow all functions in the legacy ITS package
ts-node sui/contract pause --functions "all" --version "0" InterchainTokenService
```

### Verify Version Control State

1. All functions should be enabled on v1

```bash
ts-node sui/its check-version-control 1
```

2. Only `allow_function` and `disallow_function` should be enabled on v0

```bash
ts-node sui/its check-version-control 0
```

### Re-deploy Example contract

Manually Configure Move.toml and Lock File of the `InterchainTokenService` package

Edit `./sui/move/interchain_token_service/Move.toml` with the following changes:

1. Remove the published at field
```diff
-   published-at = "..."
```

2. Update the package address in the `addresses` block:

```diff
    [addresses]
-   interchain_token_service = "0x..."
+   interchain_token_service = "0x0"
```

Edit `./sui/move/interchain_token_service/Move.lock` with the following changes:

1. Append the following blocks to the Lock file:

```diff
+   
+   [env]
+   
+   [env.testnet]
+   chain-id = "4c78adac"
+   original-published-id = "..."
+   latest-published-id = "..."
+   published-version = "2"
```

2. Ensure the value of `original-published-id` matches the value of `chains.sui.contracts.InterchainTokenService.versions["0"]`, and the value of `latest-published-id` matches the value of `chains.sui.contracts.InterchainTokenService.address`, in the contracts config.

Now, you can re-deploy the Example contract:

- Note: use PRIVATE_KEY of deployer 

```bash
ts-node sui/deploy-contract deploy Example
```

### Migrating Legacy Tokens

```bash
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10 coins per tx
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10
# Or
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10, with verbose logging
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10 --logging 10
```

### Test ITS token deployment and transfers

Test Sui Token Deployment using either lock / unlock or mint / burn token manager

```bash
# Register token with manager type: lock / unlock
ts-node sui/its-example deploy-token --origin TST "Test Token" 6
```
```bash
# Register token with manager type: mint / burn
ts-node sui/its-example deploy-token --tokenManagerMode "mint_burn" --origin TST "Test Token" 6
```

Testing Sui <-> EVM transfers

1. Send Token Deployment to Another Chain
```bash
ts-node sui/its-example send-deployment [coin-symbol] [chain] [gas-value]
# Example:
# ts-node sui/its-example send-deployment TST avalanche-fuji 0.5
```

2. Send Tokens to an EVM Chain
```bash
ts-node sui/its-example send-token [coin-symbol] [chain] [recepient-address] [gas-value] [amount-to-send]
# Example:
# ts-node sui/its-example send-token TST avalanche-fuji 0xba76c6980428A0b10CFC5d8ccb61949677A61233 0.5 1000
```

3. Send Tokens Back to Sui, from an EVM Chain
```bash
ts-node evm/its interchain-transfer sui [token-id] [recipient] [amount-to-send] --gasValue [gas-value] -n [evm-chain]
# Example: 
# ts-node evm/its interchain-transfer sui 0x334e3a13a8d0a8fc8ab5c7828fa4c664821f0a514e2ed447de9d9103352d7873 0x76f89a9b56dc580aed9f97e2b3bd03d8d24464e38522da9464c15103761c6707 25 --gasValue 5000 -n avalanche-fuji
```

### Test custom token linking

Deploy a custom token and link it to the token on the origin chain.

```bash
ts-node sui/its link-coin [coin-symbol] [coin-description] [coin-decimals] [destination-chain] [destination-token-address]
# Example
# ts-node sui/its link-coin LINK "Custom link coin" 10 ethereum-sepolia 0x3fc29836e84e471a053d2d9e80494a867d670ead
```
