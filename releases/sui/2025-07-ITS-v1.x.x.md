## Deployment

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain. On `devnet-amplifier` chain name will be set to `sui-2`.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### Fetching Legacy Tokens

"Legacy" tokens, refers to tokens with [CoinMetadata](https://docs.sui.io/references/sui-api/sui-graphql/reference/types/objects/coin-metadata) stored in ITS. These coins are not displaying correctly in wallets because their info such as token name, symbol and decimal precision cannot be read by the rpc method [getCoinMetadata](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typedoc/classes/_mysten_sui.client.SuiClient.html#getcoinmetadata).

To fix the issue these we need to determine the effected tokens. The list of legacy tokens should be fetched before conducting the ITS contract upgrade, and after the upgrade is completed, we'll use it to migrate (fix) the effected tokens.

```bash
# TODO: instructions for saving legacy token list
```

### Upgrading the ITS move contract

The upgrade policy requirement depends on what the contract was deployed with. The default choice for deployments is "any_upgrade". The possible choices for deployments are "immutable", "any_upgrade", "code_upgrade", "dep_upgrade".

```bash
# Upgrade InterchainTokenService v0 -> v1
ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService <policy>
```

### Enabling the Upgrade

```bash
# Migrate version control state to enable the upgrade
ts-node sui/deploy-contract migrate InterchainTokenService
```

- Re-deploy Example Contract

The original Example contract doesn't work after the upgrade is enabled.

```bash
# Deploy Example contract that works with upgraded ITS
ts-node sui/deploy-contract deploy Example
```

### Disabling the Legacy Contract

In the version control contract, the legacy ITS package has been replaced by the new (e.g. after running the command `ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService <policy>`). However, it still exists on chain and should be disabled to prevent node operators and relayers from calling the legacy contract after the upgrade.

To disable the legacy contract we must disallow its functions, but this should only be done after the upgraded package is live and successfully enabled.

```bash
# Disallow all functions in the legacy ITS package
ts-node sui/contract pause --functions "all" --version "0" InterchainTokenService
```

### Migrating Legacy Tokens

```bash
# TODO: instructions for migrating coins
```

## Checklist

The following checks and post-upgrade tasks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ] Test ITS token deployment
- [ ] Fetch and migrate metadata of legacy coins

#### Test ITS token deployment

```bash
# Deploy Test Tokens
ts-node sui/its-example deploy-token --origin TST1 "Test Token 1" 6

# Send Token Deployment to Gateway
ts-node sui/its-example send-deployment TST1 [destinationChain] 0.5

# Send Tokens to Destination chain
ts-node sui/its-example send-token TST1 [destinationChain] [destinationAddress] 0.5 1

# Initiate token transfer from both EVM chains too
ts-node evm/its.js --action interchainTransfer --destinationChain sui --tokenId [tokenId] --destinationAddress [recipientAddress] --amount 1 --gasValue 0.5
```

#### Fetch and migrate metadata of legacy coins

```bash
# Fetch & migrate legacy coins
# TBD
```
