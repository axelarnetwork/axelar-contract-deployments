## Deployment

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain. On `devnet-amplifier` chain name will be set to `sui-2`.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### Fetching Legacy Tokens

To fix the issue of some tokens not displaying correctly in wallets, we need to fetch the effected tokens. It's recommended to fetch this list before the ITS move contract is upgraded.

```bash
# Save legacy tokens for later migration
ts-node sui/tokens legacy-coins
```

### Upgrading the ITS move contract

```bash
# Upgrade InterchainTokenService v0 -> v1
ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService any_upgrade
```

### Enabling the Upgrade

```bash
# Migrate version control state to enable the upgrade
ts-node sui/deploy-contract migrate InterchainTokenService
```

- Re-deploy Example Contract

The original Example contract doesn't work after the upgrade is enabled.

```bash
# Deploy Example contract that works with upgraded ITS
ts-node sui/deploy-contract deploy Example
```

## Checklist

The following post-upgrade tasks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ] Disable the legacy ITS contract
- [ ] Fetch metadata of legacy coins (if not already fetched)
- [ ] Migrate metadata of legacy coins
- [ ] Test ITS token deployment

### Disabling the Legacy Contract

```bash
# Disallow all functions in the legacy ITS package
ts-node sui/contract pause --functions "all" --version "0" InterchainTokenService
```

### Migrating Legacy Tokens

Without status updates

```bash
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10
```

With status updates

```bash
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10, with verbose logging
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10 --logging 10
```

#### Test ITS token deployment

```bash
# Deploy Test Tokens
ts-node sui/its-example deploy-token --origin TST1 "Test Token 1" 6

# Send Token Deployment to Gateway
ts-node sui/its-example send-deployment TST1 [destinationChain] 0.5

# Send Tokens to Destination chain
ts-node sui/its-example send-token TST1 [destinationChain] [destinationAddress] 0.5 1

# Initiate token transfer from both EVM chains too
ts-node evm/its.js --action interchainTransfer --destinationChain sui --tokenId [tokenId] --destinationAddress [recipientAddress] --amount 1 --gasValue 0.5
```
