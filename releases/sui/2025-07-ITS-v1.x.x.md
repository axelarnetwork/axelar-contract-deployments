## Deployment

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain. On `devnet-amplifier` chain name will be set to `sui-2`.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### Upgrade Sui ITS move contract

The upgrade policy requirement depends on what the contract was deployed with. The default choice for deployments is "any_upgrade". The possible choices for deployments are "immutable", "any_upgrade", "code_upgrade", "dep_upgrade".

```bash
# Upgrade InterchainTokenService v0 -> v1
ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService <policy>
```

### Enabling the Upgrade

```bash
# Migrate version control state to enable the upgrade
ts-node sui/deploy-contract migrate InterchainTokenService
```

- Re-deploy Example Contract

The original Example contract doesn't work after the upgrade is enabled.

```bash
# Deploy Example contract that works with upgraded ITS
ts-node sui/deploy-contract deploy Example
```

### Fetching & Migrating Legacy Tokens

TBD

## Checklist

The following checks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ] Test ITS token deployment
- [ ] Check upgrade is enabled
- [ ] Fetch and migrate metadata of legacy coins

#### Test ITS token deployment

```bash
# Deploy Test Tokens
ts-node sui/its-example deploy-token --origin TST1 "Test Token 1" 6

# Send Token Deployment to Gateway
ts-node sui/its-example send-deployment TST1 [destinationChain] 0.5

# Send Tokens to Destination chain
ts-node sui/its-example send-token TST1 [destinationChain] [destinationAddress] 0.5 1

# Initiate token transfer from both EVM chains too
ts-node evm/its.js --action interchainTransfer --destinationChain sui --tokenId [tokenId] --destinationAddress [recipientAddress] --amount 1 --gasValue 0.5
```

#### Check upgrade is enabled

```bash
# Test upgrade is enabled 
# TBD
```

#### Fetch and migrate metadata of legacy coins
