[Release](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui/v/0.0.0-snapshot.3e3ec75)

## Deployment

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create a `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain. On `devnet-amplifier` chain name will be set to `sui-2`.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=<sui-deployer-key>
PRIVATE_KEY_TYPE="mnemonic" # Optional
SIGNATURE_SCHEME=secp256k1
ENV=<devnet-amplifier|stagenet|testnet|mainnet>
CHAIN=sui
```

### ITS Contract Admin & Roles

Many of the below commands require either Owner or Operator privileges on the ITS contract.

#### OwnerCap

Some commands require a wallet that owns the contract's admin capability (`OwnerCap`). By default, this will be the address that deployed the ITS v0 contract.

The commands requiring this capability are:
* [Upgrading the ITS move contract][]
* [Enabling the Upgrade][]
* [Disabling the Legacy Contract][]

#### OperatorCap

Migrating legacy coin metadata requires a `OperatorCap` capability. This is any address added as an operator for the effected coin. By default, the address that deployed and initialized the ITS v0 contract possesses a `OperatorCap`.

The commands requiring this capability are:
* [Migrating Legacy Tokens][]

### Fetching Legacy Tokens

To fix the issue of some tokens not displaying correctly in wallets, we need to fetch the effected tokens. This list can be fetched before, or after the upgrade.

```bash
# Save legacy tokens for later migration
ts-node sui/tokens legacy-coins
```

### Upgrading the ITS move contract ###

1. Update the release dependency in `package.json`

```diff
- "@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui": "1.1.3",
+ "@axelar-network/axelar-cgp-sui": "0.0.0-snapshot.3e3ec75",
```

and run
```bash
npm i
```

2. Update the move contracts locally

```bash
node sui/deploy-contract sync
```
3. Do the upgrade tx

```bash
# Upgrade InterchainTokenService v0 -> v1
ts-node sui/deploy-contract upgrade InterchainTokenService any_upgrade
```

### Enabling the Upgrade ###

Migrate version control state to enable the upgrade. 

```bash
ts-node sui/deploy-contract migrate InterchainTokenService
```

## Checklist

The following post-upgrade tasks should be performed after the rollout

- [ ] Disable the legacy ITS contract
- [ ] Verify Version Control state (v0 and v1)
- [ ] Re-deploy Example contract
- [ ] Fetch metadata of legacy coins (if not already fetched)
- [ ] Migrate metadata of legacy coins
- [ ] Test ITS token deployment

### Disabling the Legacy Contract ###

```bash
# Disallow all functions in the legacy ITS package
ts-node sui/contract pause --functions "all" --version "0" InterchainTokenService
```

### Verify Version Control State

1. All functions should be enabled on v1

```bash
ts-node sui/its check-version-control 1
```

2. Only `allow_function` and `disallow_function` should be enabled on v0

```bash
ts-node sui/its check-version-control 0
```

### Migrating Legacy Tokens ###

```bash
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10 coins per tx
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10
# Or
# Migrate legacy tokens in batches of 10, with verbose logging
ts-node sui/its migrate-coin-metadata-all --batch 10 --logging 10
```

#### Test ITS token deployment

Test interchain token deployment and transfer with EVM(consensus and amplifier) chains and Stellar.
