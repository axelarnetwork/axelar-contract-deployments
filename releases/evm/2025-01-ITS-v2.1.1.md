[Changelog](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v2.1.1/CHANGELOG.md)

## Background

Changes in the release:

1. Remove auto-migration of interchain token minter from ITS to the its token manager, now that it's been completed for all tokens. This also allows custom tokens linked via the legacy approach to now be transferred.

## Deployment

- The rollout involves upgrading EVM ITS contracts from `v2.1.0` to `v2.1.1` on all EVM chains with ITS.

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=xyz
ENV=xyz
CHAINS=all
```

| *Type* | *SALT* |
|---------|--------|
| Devnet Amplifier ITS | `v2.1.1 devnet-amplifier` |
| Devnet Consensus ITS | `v2.1.1 consensus devnet-amplifier` |
| Other Networks | `v2.1.1` |

```bash
# Deploy new implementation
ts-node evm/deploy-its.js -s "$SALT" -m create2 --reuseProxy

ts-node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

### Verify Upgraded ITS Contracts

Please follow this [instruction](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/tree/main/evm#contract-verification) to verify ITS contracts on EVM chains.

## Checklist

The following checks should be performed after the rollout.

- Run post-deployment checks.

```bash
ts-node evm/its.js --action checks -n $CHAIN -y
```

- Test that an ITS token can still be transferred as usual (via any UI like Squid).

- Test that partners using legacy linked tokens (e.g. Unergy) are now able to transfer their token.
