[Release](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

[Changelog](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v/CHANGELOG.md#210)

## Background

Changes in the release:

1. Route all token transfers through the hub
2. Allow operator or owner to set trusted chains

## Deployment

- Ensure that ITS Hub has been upgraded to [v1.2.0](../cosmwasm/2025-01-ITS-v1.1.0.md) first
- The rollout involves upgrading EVM ITS contracts from `v2.1.0` to `v2.2.0` on all EVM chains with ITS (amplifier + consensus).

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=xyz
ENV=xyz
CHAINS=all
```

### Devnet Amplifier

Amplifier ITS

```bash
# Deploy new implementation
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0 devnet-amplifier" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

Consensus ITS

```bash
# Deploy new implementation. Since there is overlap between amplifier/consensus chains, add consensus in the salt
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0 consensus devnet-amplifier" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

### Stagenet / Testnet / Mainnet

```bash
# Deploy new implementation
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```


### Verify Upgraded ITS Contracts

Please follow this [instruction](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/tree/main/evm#contract-verification) to verify ITS contracts on EVM chains.

## Checklist

The following checks should be performed after the rollout.

- Run post-deployment checks.

```bash
node evm/its.js --action checks -n $CHAIN -y
```

- Perform an interchain transfer using one of the p2p tokens registered during the ITS hub [migration](../cosmwasm/2025-04-ITS-v1.2.0.md). Perform this test twice: once sending from a non-ethereum consensus chain to an amplifier chain, and once from an amplifier chain to a non-ethereum consensus chain.

```bash
node evm/its.js --action interchainTransfer --destinationChain chain2 --tokenId [tokenId] --destinationAddress [recipient] --amount 1 --gasValue 0
```
