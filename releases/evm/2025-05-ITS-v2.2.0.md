[Changelog](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/interchain-token-service/blob/v2.2.0/CHANGELOG.md#220)

## Background

Changes in the release:

1. Route everything through the ITS Hub, and only accept calls routed through the ITS Hub.
1. Simplify ITS Edge interchain transfer API and re-introduce `callContraactWithInterchainToken`.
1. Remove express call metadata and metadata version.
1. Switch to using `payGas` instead of `payNativeGasForContractCall` in callContract.
1. Support handling of large flow limits.
1. Transfer trusted chain management to the operator, simplifying validation since the ITS Hub blocks unregistered chains.
1. Remove Gateway caller.

## Deployment

- Ensure that ITS Hub has been upgraded to [v1.2.1](../cosmwasm/2025-01-ITS-v1.2.1.md) first
- The rollout involves upgrading EVM ITS contracts from `v2.1.0` to `v2.2.0` on all EVM chains with ITS (amplifier + consensus).

```bash
# Clone latest main and update deps
npm ci && npm run build
```

Create an `.env` config. Use `all` for `CHAINS` to run the cmd for every EVM chain, or set a specific chain.

```yaml
PRIVATE_KEY=xyz
ENV=xyz
CHAINS=all
```

### Devnet Amplifier

Amplifier ITS

```bash
# Deploy new implementation
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0 devnet-amplifier" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

Consensus ITS

```bash
# Deploy new implementation. Since there is overlap between amplifier/consensus chains, add consensus in the salt
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0 consensus devnet-amplifier" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

### Stagenet / Testnet / Mainnet

```bash
# Deploy new implementation
node evm/deploy-its.js -s "v2.2.0" -m create2 --reuseProxy

# Upgrade proxy
node evm/deploy-its.js --upgrade
```

### Verify Upgraded ITS Contracts

Please follow this [instruction](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-contract-deployments/tree/main/evm#contract-verification) to verify ITS contracts on EVM chains.

## Checklist

The following checks should be performed after the rollout.

- Run post-deployment checks.

```bash
node evm/its.js checks -n $CHAIN -y
```

- Run the following for two EVM chains (one Amplifier, one consensus, with different decimals for each token)

```bash
# Create a token on chain. Substitute the `wallet` below with the deployer key
ts-node evm/interchainTokenFactory.js deploy-interchain-token --name [name] --symbol [symbol] --decimals [decimals] --initialSupply [initial_supply] --minter [wallet]  --chainNames $CHAIN --salt [some salt]


# Deploy token to a remote chain
ts-node evm/interchainTokenFactory.js deploy-remote-interchain-token --destinationChain [destination_chain] --chainNames $CHAIN   --salt [same salt as above] -y


# Transfer token to remote chain
node evm/its.js interchain-transfer [destination-chain] [tokenId] [recipient] 1 --gasValue 1000000000000000000 -n $CHAIN

# Transfer token back from remote chain
node evm/its.js interchain-transfer $CHAIN [tokenId] [destination-address] 1 --gasValue 1000000000000000000 -n [destination-chain]
```
