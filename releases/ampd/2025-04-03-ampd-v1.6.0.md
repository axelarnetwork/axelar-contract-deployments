[Release](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.6.0)

## Background
This ampd release includes support for XRPL, as well as a bug fix for case sensitivity of chain names.
A config change is introduced which is not backwards compatible. Verifiers must update their config
at the time of deployment.

## Config change
Previously there was one config entry for signing, used by all chains. It looked like the below:

```
[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqecnww6'
```

Now, there must be one for every chain supported, along with the chain name. The old entry should be deleted.
```
[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqecnww6'
chain_name = 'ethereum'

[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar1qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqecnww6'
chain_name = 'xrpl'
```

Be sure to include all supported chains. For every message verifier handler specified in the config (including ones for non-evm chains), there must be a corresponding `MultisigSigner` config entry. Each entry should have the same
type and cosmwasm_contract values, and differ only in chain name. The chain name must match the registered chain name. The cosmwasm_contract value is the address of the multisig contract.

For mainnet, at the time of writing, the values should look like so:
```
[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5'
chain_name = 'flow'

[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5'
chain_name = 'sui'

[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5'
chain_name = 'stellar'

[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5'
chain_name = 'xrpl'

[[handlers]]
type = 'MultisigSigner'
cosmwasm_contract = 'axelar14a4ar5jh7ue4wg28jwsspf23r8k68j7g5d6d3fsttrhp42ajn4xq6zayy5'
chain_name = 'xrpl-evm'
```

Be sure to delete the existing `MultisigSigner` config entry.

## Deployment
Update the config, and then restart ampd with the new binary. Binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.6.0)
