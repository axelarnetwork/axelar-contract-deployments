[Release v1.13.2](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.13.2)

## Background

This release is required for ampd to support axelard v1.3.2. Do *not* upgrade to this version *before* [deploying axelard v1.3.2]. But once axelard v1.3.2 is deployed, you *have to* upgrade ampd to this version.

[deploying axelard v1.3.2]: ../axelard/2025-11-v1.3.2.md

## Config changes

The following default values have been updated for ~1s block times. Validators can either update these values in their config or remove them to use the new defaults:

| Parameter | Old Default | New Default |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `poll_interval` | `5s` | `1s` |
| `broadcast.broadcast_interval` | `5s` | `1s` |

## Deployment

Restart `ampd` with the new binary after deploying axelard v1.3.2. Binaries can be found at [axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.13.2](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.13.2).

**Important**: If you are upgrading directly from ampd v1.12.x, you need to do the correct adjustments to the config file according to the [ampd v1.13.0 release doc].

[ampd v1.13.0 release doc]: ../ampd/2025-10-28-ampd-v1.13.0.md

### Checklist

Run the below command to output the version:

```sh
$ ampd --version
ampd 1.13.2
```

Check `ampd` logs to ensure it restarts fine. Monitor voting and signing for your verifier on axelarscan to verify it's operating correctly.
