[Release TBD](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.14.0)

## Background

This release is required for ampd to support axelard v1.3.0. Do *not* upgrade to this version *before* [deploying axelard v1.3.0]. But once axelard v1.3.0 is deployed, you *have to* upgrade ampd to this version.

[deploying axelard v1.3.0]: ../axelard/2025-11-v1.3.0.md

## Deployment

Restart `ampd` with the new binary after deploying axelard v1.3.0. Binaries can be found at [axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.14.0](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/releases/tag/ampd-v1.14.0).

### Checklist

Run the below command to output the version:

```sh
$ ampd --version
ampd 1.14.0
```

Check `ampd` logs to ensure it restarts fine. Monitor voting and signing for your verifier on axelarscan to verify it's operating correctly.
